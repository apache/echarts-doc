{{target: partial-zlevel}}

#${prefix|default("#")} zlevel(number) = ${defaultZLevel|default(-10)}

The layer in which the component is located.

`zlevel` is used to make layers with Canvas. Graphical elements with different `zlevel` values will be placed in different Canvases, which is a common optimization technique. We can put those frequently changed elements (like those with animations) to a separate `zlevel`. Notice that too many Canvases will increase memory cost, and should be used carefully on mobile phones to avoid the crash.

Canvases with bigger `zlevel` will be placed on Canvases with smaller `zlevel`.

**Note:** The layers of the components in echarts-gl need to be separated from the layers of the components in echarts. The same `zlevel` cannot be used for both WebGL and Canvas drawing at the same time.
