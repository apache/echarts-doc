Icons can be set to arbitrary vector path via `'path://'` in ECharts. As compared with a raster image, vector paths prevent jagging and blurring when scaled, and have better control over changing colors. The size of the vector icon will be adapted automatically. Refer to [SVG PathData](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData) for more information about the format of the path. You may export vector paths from tools like Adobe
