#series
Series list. Each series decides its diagram type through `type`.

ECharts-gl adds a rich 3D visualization type.
Including [3D bar] (~series.bar3D), [3D scatter] (~series.scatter3D), [3D lines] (~series.lines3D), [surface] (~series. Surface),
Most visualization types can be used in a variety of coordinate system components, and are well integrated with the original echarts legend, tooltip, and other interactive components.

At the same time, more functional enhancements have been made to the original 2D chart. For example, for scatter chart and diagrams of large amounts of data, you can use [scatterGL](~series.scatterGL), [graphGL](~series.graphGL) provided in echarts-gl to speed up drawing and operations.
