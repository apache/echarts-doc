## barWidth(number|string) = null

The width of the bar. Adaptive when not specified.

<ExampleUIControlPercent />

{{ use: partial-barGrid-value-absolute-or-percent() }}

{{ use: partial-barGrid-share-desc(
    seriesType = ${seriesType}
) }}

## barMaxWidth(number|string) = null

The maximum width of the bar.

Has higher priority than [barWidth](~series-bar.barWidth).

{{ use: partial-barGrid-value-absolute-or-percent() }}

{{ use: partial-barGrid-share-desc(
    seriesType = ${seriesType}
) }}

## barMinWidth(number|string)

The minimum width of the bar. In cartesian the default value is `1`, otherwise the default value if `null`.

Has higher priority than [barWidth](~series-bar.barWidth).

{{ use: partial-barGrid-value-absolute-or-percent() }}

{{ use: partial-barGrid-share-desc(
    seriesType = ${seriesType}
) }}

## barMinHeight(number) = 0

The minimum width of bar. It could be used to avoid the following situation: the interaction would be affected when the value of some data item is too small.

## barMinAngle(number) = 0

The minimum angle of bar. It could be used to avoid the following situation: the interaction would be affected when the value of some data item is too small. Valid only for bar series on polar coordinates.

<ExampleUIControlNumber min="0" />

## barGap(string) = ${barGapDefault|default('20%')}

<ExampleUIControlPercent default="${barGapDefault|default('20%')}"/>

The gap between bars between different series, is a percent value like `'20%'`, which means `20%` of the bar width.

Set barGap as `'-100%'` can overlap bars that belong to different series, which is useful when making a series of bar be background.

{{ use: partial-barGrid-share-desc(
    seriesType = ${seriesType}
) }}

For example:
~[600x400](${galleryViewPath}doc-example/barGrid-barGap&reset=1&edit=1)

## barCategoryGap(number|string)

The bar gap of a single series, by default, a suitable spacing is calculated based on the number of series in the bar chart. When there are more series, the spacing will be appropriately reduced, can be set as a fixed value.

{{ use: partial-barGrid-share-desc(
    seriesType = ${seriesType}
) }}



{{ target: partial-barGrid-share-desc }}

In a single coordinate system, this attribute is shared by multiple `'${seriesType}'` series. This attribute should be set on the last `'${seriesType}'` series in the coordinate system, then it will be adopted by all `'${seriesType}'` series in the coordinate system.



{{ target: partial-barGrid-value-absolute-or-percent }}

Can be an absolute value like `40` or a percent value like `'60%'`. The percent is based on the calculated category width.
