## dataGroupId(string)

A group ID assigned to all data items in the series.

This option has a lower priority than `groupId`, which means when `groupId` is specified for a certain data item the `dataGroupId` will be simply ignored for that data item. For more information, please see `series.data.groupId`.


{{ target: partial-data-group-id }}

#${prefix} groupId(string)

The group ID of a data item. When `universalTransition` is enabled, the data items from the old option and those from the new one, if sharing a same group ID, will then be matched and applied to a proper animation after `setOption` is called.

If a data item is not specified with a `groupId`, Apache ECharts will try to use `series.dataGroupId` as the group ID for the data item. If `series.dataGroupId` is not specified either, Apache ECharts will fall back to using the data item's ID as its group ID.

If you are using the [dataset](~dataset) component to represent data, you are recommended to use `encode.itemGroupId` to specify the dimension that is to be encoded as the group ID.


{{ target: partial-data-child-group-id }}

#${prefix} childGroupId(string)

The group ID of the child data of a data item. This option is introduced to make multiple levels drilldown and aggregation animation possilbe.

~[700x300](${galleryViewPath}doc-example/bar-drilldown&edit=1&reset=1)

Before `childGroupId` is introduced, developers actually can use `groupId` to make drilldown and aggregation animation already, but with the limit on the times that a continious drilldown or aggregation can happen, which is only one time.

`childGroupId`, together with `groupId`, help to form "parent-child" relationships between data items of different options, such as:

```text
data: [                        data: [                        data: [
  {                              {                              {
    name: 'Animals',               name: 'Dogs',                  name: 'Corgi',
    value: 3,                      value: 3,                      value: 5,
    groupId: 'things',             groupId: 'animals',            groupId: 'dogs'
    childGroupId: 'animals'        childGroupId: 'dogs'         },
  },                             },                             {
  {                              {                                name: 'Bulldog',
    name: 'Fruits',                name: 'Cats',                  value: 6,
    value: 3,                      value: 4,                      groupId: 'dogs'
    groupId: 'things',             groupId: 'animals',          },
    childGroupId: 'fruits'         childGroupId: 'cats',        {
  },                             },                               name: 'Shiba Inu',
  {                              {                                value: 7,
    name: 'Cars',                  name: 'Birds',                 groupId: 'dogs'
    value: 2,                      value: 3,                    }
    groupId: 'things',             groupId: 'animals',        ]
    childGroupId: 'cars'           childGroupId: 'birds'
  }                              }
]                              ]
```

The 3 groups of data above come from 3 options, and by specifying `groupId` and `childGroupId` for the data items a relationship of "parent-child-grandChild" is formed in the 3 options. In this way,  after `setOption` is called, Apache ECharts will try to find the "parent-child" or "child-parent" relationship of the old option and the new one. If the relationship exists, the matching data items will be applied to a drilldown animation or an aggregation one.

If a data item has no child data then there is no need to specify a `childGroupId` at all.

If you are using the [dataset](~dataset) component to represent data, you are recommended to use `encode.itemChildGroupId` to specify the dimension that is to be encoded as the child group ID.
