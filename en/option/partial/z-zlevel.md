#${prefix|default("#")} zlevel(number) = ${defaultZLevel|default(0)}

`zlevel` value of all graphical elements in ${componentName}.

`zlevel` is used to make layers with Canvas. Graphical elements with different `zlevel` values will be placed in different Canvases, which is a common optimization technique. We can put those frequently changed elements (like those with animations) to a separate `zlevel`. Notice that too many Canvases will increase memory cost, and should be used carefully on mobile phones to avoid crash.

Canvases with bigger `zlevel` will be placed on Canvases with smaller `zlevel`.

#${prefix|default("#")} z(number) = ${defaultZ|default(2)}

`z` value of all graphical elements in ${componentName}, which controls order of drawing graphical components. Components with smaller `z` values may be overwritten by those with larger `z` values.

`z` has a lower priority to `zlevel`, and will not create new Canvas.
