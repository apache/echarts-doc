# Supporting ARIA in Charts

W3C defined the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite ([WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria)) to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to the disabled. From ECharts 4.0, we support ARIA by generating description for charts automatically.

By default, ARIA is disabled. To enable it, you should set [aria.show](~aria.show) to be `true`. After enabling, it will generate descriptions based on charts, series, data, and so on. Users may change the generated description.

**For example:**

For config:

```js
option = {
    aria: {
        show: true
    },
    title: {
        text: 'Source of user access to a site',
        x: 'center'
    },
    series: [
        {
             Name: 'access source',
            type: 'pie',
            data: [
                { value: 335, name: 'direct access' },
                { value: 310, name: 'mail marketing' },
                { value: 234, name: 'union ad' },
                { value: 135, name: 'video ad' },
                { value: 1548, name: 'search engine' }
            ]
        }
    ]
};
```

~[700x300](${galleryViewPath}doc-example/aria-pie&edit=1&reset=1)

There should be an `aria-label` attribute on the chart DOM, which can help the disabled understand the content of charts with the help of certain devices. The value of the label is:

```
This is a chart of "Source of user access to a site." The chart type is a pie chart that indicates the source of the visit. The data is - direct access data is 335, mail marketing data is 310, union ad data is 234, video ad data is 135, search engine data is 1548.
```

The default language is in Chinese, but you can configure it with templates.

Please refer to [ARIA option](option.html#aria) for more detail.
