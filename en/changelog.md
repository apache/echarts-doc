## v5.0.0
<div class="time">2020-12-03</div>

+ Migrate codebase to TypeScript:
    + The entire code base have been migrated to TypeScript.
    + Provide DTS for the upper TS based applications, where the TS version supported is down to 3.5.
    + See more details in [#13563](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/13563)
+ [Feature] States enhancement:
    + Support state transition animation, which brings better interaction effect when highlighting or downplaying some part of the chart.
    + Besides the state "emphasis" we already have, v5.0 provides two more configurable state: "select" and "blur" in all series. The option of them are the same as the existing "emphasis". "blur" is used the elements need to fade out when focusing some other elements. "select" is used when the element is selected by mouse/touch click or API triggering.
    + Support to blur other graphic elements when highlighting specified data through mouseover or hover linking. See examples [bar-label-rotation](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=bar-label-rotation), [bar-polar-stack](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=bar-polar-stack), [bar-stack](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=bar-stack), [area-stack](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=area-stack), [dataset-link](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=dataset-link), [scatter-weight](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=scatter-weight), [tree-basic](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=tree-basic).
    + Unify the previous different state configurations in series, like `highlightPolicy`, `focusNodeAdjacency`, `hoverOffset`, by the option `focus`, `blurScope` and `scale`. See examples [sankey-energy](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=sankey-energy), [graph](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=graph), [sunburst-drink](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=sunburst-drink).
    + See more details in [#12925](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/12925) and [#12911](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/12911).
+ [Feature] Provide a more powerful label support:
    + Use some strategies to bring better displayed labels, including:
        + Smarter text color strategy to make labels more easy to be distinguished from different background.
        + Smarter label layout in pie chart, especially when there are too many labels or insufficient space. And related issue: [#6050](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/issues/6050).
        + Provide more overflow configurations.
    + Provide option set `labelLayout` to enable more abilities for developers to tweak the layout of the labels after it's originally positioned by the chart itself. With the options in `labelLayout`, developers can:
        + Avoid labels overlap (see [scatter-label-align-right](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=graph-label-overlap)),
        + Make special label alignment, and adjust label position, etc.. See the examples [pie-alignTo](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=pie-alignTo), [pie-labelLine-adjust](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=pie-labelLine-adjust), [pie-label-distanceToLabelLine](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=doc-example/pie-label-distanceToLabelLine), [pie-label-bleedMargin](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=doc-example/pie-label-bleedMargin).
        + Make label draggable.
    + Support `labelLine` for all series, which is very useful for guiding element to related labels when labels have to be far away from the elements. See examples [scatter-label-align-right](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=scatter-label-align-right), [scatter-label-align-top](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=scatter-label-align-top). Related issues: [#11534](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/issues/11534), [#12971](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/issues/12971).
    + Support `series.endLabel` in line series. Label can be displayed at the end of a line.
    + Support label text animation, that is, the transition animation on text when the number text changed. Can be enabled by `series.label.valueAnimation`, `series.endLabel.valueAnimation`. See more details in [#13246](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/13246) and [#13045](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/13045).
    + See other details in [#12911](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/12911).
+ [Feature] Support bar realtime sorting by `series.realtimeSort`. See examples [bar-race](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=bar-race), and see more details in the original pull request [#12484](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/12484).
+ [Feature] Support data transform plug-in:
    + Data transform is a new set of configurations and APIs to enable data transformation based on `dataset` in declarative way. Built-in or third-party data transformer can be made as plug-ins to provide various transform algorithms. ECharts users can use those transformers in ECharts option.
    + See examples [data-transform-filter](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=data-transform-filter), [data-transform-sort-bar](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=data-transform-sort-bar), [data-transform-multiple-pie](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=data-transform-multiple-pie), [doc-example/data-transform-multiple-sort-bar](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=doc-example/data-transform-multiple-sort-bar), [boxplot-light-velocity](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=boxplot-light-velocity), [bar-histogram](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=bar-histogram), [scatter-clustering](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=scatter-clustering), [scatter-exponential-regression](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=scatter-exponential-regression), [scatter-linear-regression](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=scatter-linear-regression), [scatter-logarithmic-regression](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=scatter-logarithmic-regression), [scatter-polynomial-regression](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=scatter-polynomial-regression). See more details in [#13065](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/13065), #13127](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/13127).
+ [Feature] Provide more smarter time axis label and tick arrangement:
    + See more details in [#12859](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/12859).
+ [Feature] Support `decal`:
    + Decal provides a new visual type that does not only augment aria scenarios but also enrich visual effects.
    + See more details in [#13304](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/13304).
+ [Feature] Support transition animation in custom series.
    + Transition animation can be auto performed by setting property `transition` for transform related properties, style properties and shape properties. See [custom-gauge](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=custom-gauge).
    + Support morphing/combining/separating by setting property `morph` on elements definitions. See examples [custom-combine-separate-morph](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=custom-combine-separate-morph), [custom-one-to-one-morph](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=custom-one-to-one-morph), [custom-story-transition](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=custom-story-transition), [custom-spiral-race](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=custom-spiral-race).
    + Support customized transition animation by callback `during`. See the example [custom-spiral-race](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=custom-spiral-race), and see more details in [#12775](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/12775).
    + See more details in [#12775](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/12775), [#13468](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/13468), [#13271](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/13271).
+ [Feature] Provide a more powerful gauge:
    + See examples [gauge-barometer](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=gauge-barometer), [gauge-clock](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=gauge-clock), [gauge-multi-title](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=gauge-multi-title), [gauge-progress](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=gauge-progress), [gauge-ring](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=gauge-ring), [gauge-grade](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=gauge-grade), [gauge-simple](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=gauge-simple), [gauge-temperature](https://echarts.apache.org/next/examples/en/editor.html?c=gauge-temperature).

    + [Fix] Skip rendering for data out of axis content in heatmap. [#12991](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/12991).
+ [Break] Breaking changes against v4.9:
    + The default theme colors has been changed. If intending to use the theme of v4.9-, please set `option.color = ['#c23531', '#2f4554', '#61a0a8', '#d48265', '#91c7ae', '#749f83', '#ca8622', '#bda29a', '#6e7074', '#546570', '#c4ccd3'];`.
    + Remove built-in map geoJSON. [#13565](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/13565).
    + Drop the support of the legacy IE8. The previous VML renderer (necessary in IE8) will not be updated to work in v5.0.
    + The exported modules from `'echarts/lib/export.js'` is not mounted to `'echarts/lib/echarts.js'` by default. If the upper application previously used `import * as echarts from 'echarts/lib/echarts'` and used any of the exported modules in `'echarts/lib/export.js'`, please change the import code to `import echarts from 'echarts/index.blank'`, where the modules from `'echarts/lib/export.js'` are mounted by default.
    + If the upper application previously imported `src/echarts.js`, `src/chart/*.js` and `src/component/*.js`, it can not work any more because all of the files in `/src` folder are migrated to `*.ts`.
    + The priority of the visuals between `visualMap` and `itemStyle`|`lineStyle`|`areaStyle` are reversed. That is, previously, the visuals (i.e., color, symbol, symbolSize, ...) that generated by the component `visualMap` has highest priority, which will overwrite the same visuals specified in `itemStyle`|`lineStyle`|`areaStyle`. That brought trouble to specify specific style to some certain data items. Since v5.0, the visuals specified in `itemStyle`|`lineStyle`|`areaStyle` has highest priority.
    + The behavior of `rich.?.padding` are changed. Previously `rich.?.padding: [11, 22, 33, 44]` indicates that padding-top is `33` and padding-bottom is `11`, which is a buggy implementation because it is different from what CSS did. Since v5.0, we fix it: `rich.?.padding: [11, 22, 33, 44]` indicates padding-top is `11` and padding-bottom is `33`.
    + `aria` is not included in `dist/echarts.simple(.min).js` since v5.0. But it is still included in `dist/echarts.common(.min).js` and `dist/echarts(.min).js`.
+ [Deprecated] Deprecated usages since v5.0:
    + Transform related props of a graphic element are changed:
        + Changes:
            + `position: [number, number]` are changed to `x: number`/`y: number`.
            + `scale: [number, number]` are changed to `scaleX: number`/`scaleY: number`.
            + `origin: [number, number]` are changed to `originX: number`/`originY: number`.
        + The `position`, `scale` and `origin` are still supported but deprecated.
        + It effects these places:
            + In the `graphic` components: the declarations of each element.
            + In `custom series`: the declarations of each element in the return of `renderItem`.
            + Directly use zrender graphic elements.
    + Text related props on graphic elements are changed:
        + Changes:
            + The declaration of attached text (or say, rect text) are changed.
                + Prop `style.text` are deprecated in elements except `Text`. Instead, Prop set `textContent` and `textConfig` are provided to support more powerful capabilities.
                + These related props at the left part below are deprecated. Use the right part below instead.
                    + textPosition => textConfig.position
                    + textOffset => textConfig.offset
                    + textRotation => textConfig.rotation
                    + textDistance => textConfig.distance
            + The props at the left part below are deprecated in `style` and `style.rich.?`. Use the props at the right part below instead.
                + textFill => fill
                + textStroke => stroke
                + textFont => font
                + textStrokeWidth => lineWidth
                + textAlign => align

                + textHeight => hight
                + textBackgroundColor => backgroundColor
                + textPadding => padding
                + textBorderColor => borderColor
                + textBorderWidth => borderWidth
                + textBorderRadius => borderRadius
                + textBoxShadowColor => shadowColor
                + textBoxShadowBlur => shadowBlur
                + textBoxShadowOffsetX => shadowOffsetX
                + textBoxShadowOffsetY => shadowOffsetY
            + Note: these props are not changed:
                + textShadowColor
                + textShadowBlur
                + textShadowOffsetX
                + textShadowOffsetY
        + It effects these places:
            + In the `graphic` components: the declarations of each element. [compat, but not accurately the same in some complicated cases.]
            + In `custom series`: the declarations of each element in the return of `renderItem`. [compat, but not accurately the same in some complicated cases].
            + Directly use zrender API to create graphic elements. [No compat, breaking change].
    + API on chart instance:
        + `chart.one(...)` is deprecated.
    + `label`:
        + In props `color`, `textBorderColor`, `backgroundColor` and `borderColor`, the value `'auto'` is deprecated. Use the value `'inherit'` instead.
    + `hoverAnimation`:
        + option `series.hoverAnimation` is deprecated. Use `series.emphasis.scale` instead.
    + `line series`:
        + option `series.clipOverflow` is deprecated. Use `series.clip` instead.
    + `custom series`:
        + In `renderItem`, the `api.style(...)` and `api.styleEmphasis(...)` are deprecated. Because it is not really necessary and hard to ensure backward compatibility. Users can fetch system designated visual by `api.visual(...)`.
    + `sunburst series`:
        + Action type `highlight` is deprecated. Use `sunburstHighlight` instead.
        + Action type `downplay` is deprecated. Use `sunburstUnhighlight` instead.
        + option `series.downplay` is deprecated. Use `series.blur` instead.

## v4.0.1
<div class="time">2018-01-17</div>

## v4.0.0
<div class="time">2018-01-16</div>

+ [+] Supported to render up to **tens millions of data** directly. ECharts4 has upgrade to stream architecture, and along with detailed optimization, it has supported to render incrementally loaded data and support progressive rendering.
    + Ten millions of GIS data probably take up to about hundreds MB of space. In this case chunked data loading or WebStock is required for the purpose of display graphics as soon as possible and not blocking the browser while processing loaded data. The samples of incremental data loading can be checked here: [scatterGL-gps](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-examples/public/editor.html?c=scatterGL-gps&gl=1) and [linesGL-ny](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-examples/public/editor.html?c=linesGL-ny&gl=1), who use ECharts GL, and [lines-ny](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-examples/public/editor.html?c=lines-ny), who only uses ECharts.
    + Supported the human interactions in the big data scenario, where continuous interactions (e.g., roam in geo and cartesian) will not block the browser. Benefit from the using of GPU and avoiding of layout recalculation, ECharts GL provides smooth interactions, which has been demonstrated in the examples above. Without WebGL, the basic ECharts implements progressive rendering to support non-blocking interaction, which can be checked at the pan and zoom in [lines-airline](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-examples/public/editor.html?c=lines-airline) and [scatter-large](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-examples/public/editor.html?c=scatter-large).

+ [+] **Published ZRender SVG Rendering Engine** as an alternative backend of ECharts besides the existing Canvas Rendering Engine. The choice of rendering engine usually depends on the scenario, for example, benefit from the low memory cost, SVG Rendering Engine is suitable for mobile device, or the case that many ECharts instances exists in a single page, while the Canvas Rendering Engine is suitable for big data rendering or when visual effects required. Canvas Rendering Engine is default rendering engine. See [zrender](https://github.com/ecomfe/zrender).

+ [+] **Published Sunburst Chart** to visualize hierarchical data efficiently with excellent interactions. See [examples] and (excellent) and [docs](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#series-sunburst).

+ [+] **Published [dataset](http://echarts.baidu.com/tutorial.html#%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E9%9B%86%EF%BC%88dataset%EF%BC%89) component** to support data based configuration, visual encoding and data sharing in different series.

+ [+] **Supported WAI-ARIA (the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite）** to help the disabled people to access the data visualization in web.

+ [+] Since ECharts4, the options `label` and `itemStyle` has been flattened. The original level of `normal` is not needed any more, which make ECharts option more neat. As always, **The previous option style in ECharts3 is still be compatible**.

+ [+] Added two color themes, named 'light' and 'dark'. Apply them by `echarts.init(dom, themeName);`.

+ [+] Supported that auto collect legend names when [legend.data](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#legend.data) is not specified.

+ [+] Supported that auto collect category names when `axis.type` is `'category'` and [axis.data](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#xAxis.data) is not specified.


## v3.8.4
<div class="time">2017-11-13</div>

+ [^] Fixed that `registerMap` is null on `index*.js`.
+ [^] Fixed some CommonJS incorrect brought by injection.


## v3.8.2
<div class="time">2017-11-10</div>

+ [^] Fixed backward compatibility problems brounght by `3.8.0`:
    + In `3.8.0`, the content in `lib` directory is the same as the content in `src` directory (both are ES Module), which may not compatible with the old versions of node and webpack. So rollback to commonJS format in `lib` of `3.8.2`.
    + In `3.8.0`, the source code in `src` constains global variable `__DEV__` (which prints dev helper info for echarts users). To get the declaration of the global variable, users should include `echarts/src/config.js` manually or make some settings in `webpack`/`rollup` (Check [custom build tutorial](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#Create%20Custom%20Build%20of%20ECharts) please), which is not backward compatible. So we have removed `__DEV__` from the codes in `echarts/lib/**` in `3.8.2`. If dev helper info is required, use codes in `echarts/src/**`.
    + After `3.8`, `echarts/src/echarts.js` (the same as `echarts/lib/echarts.js` in `3.8.0`) does not include util methods, which used to be mounted on it. Now util methods are listed in `echarts/src/export` and mounted on `echarts/echarts*.js`. But it is not backward compatibility, so we have rollbacked to mount them on `echarts/lib/echarts.js` in `3.8.2`.
    + The way of including `echarts/extension/dataTool`, havs been rollbacked to the original approach before `3.8`, where it must be included explicitly, and the namespace will be mounted on `echarts` namespame.
+ [^] Fixed the problem that SVG renderer throws error when encounter null value.


## v3.8,0
<div class="time">2017-11-07</div>

+ [+] **Supported [Tree Chart](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#series-tree)**, including [horizontal layout](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-examples/public/index.html#tree-basic), [vertical layout](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-examples/public/index.html#tree-vertical), [radial layout](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-examples/public/index.html#tree-radial).

+ [+] **Supported [SVG Renderer (beta)](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#Render%20by%20Canvas%20or%20SVG)**, enable developers to choose SVG or Canvas renderer based on their platfroms and functional requirments.

+ [+] Source code of echarts has been switched to ES Module, which enabled tree shaking of bundle and reduced size.

+ [+] Supported build scripts for creating custom build, including multiple language support. See [custom build tutorial](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#Create%20Custom%20Build%20of%20ECharts).

+ [+] Supported [strokeWidth](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#series-treemap.levels.itemStyle.normal.strokeWidth) and [strokeColor](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#series-treemap.levels.itemStyle.normal.strokeColor) in treemap. See [#6804](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/issues/6804).

+ [+] Supported [show adjacent nodes](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#series-graph.focusNodeAdjacency) in graph. See [#6772](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/issues/6772).

+ [^] Fixed the area calculation when [grid.containLabel](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#grid.containLabel) is `true` and axis is [rotated](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#yAxis.axisLabel.rotate). Thanks [xvaara](https://github.com/xvaara) for [PR #6951](https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts/pull/6951).

+ [^] Fixed that the calculation of interval is not incorrect when [axisLabel.rotate](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#xAxis.axisLabel.rotate) is set in [category axis](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#xAxis.type).

+ `dist/echarts/echarts.simple.js` do not includ utils, which used to be mounted on `echarts`. `dist/echarts/echarts.common.js` and `dist/echarts/echarts.js` keep including them as before. And developers can [custom build](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#Create%20Custom%20Build%20of%20ECharts) to include them.

+ Changes about `dataTool`: When using `dist/echarts/echarts.simple.js` or `dist/echarts/echarts.common.js`, `dist/echarts/extension/dataTool.js` should be manually included as before, but the namespace `dataTool` will not be mounted to `echarts`. When using `dist/echarts/echarts.js`, `echarts.dataTool` is included automatically by default.

+ [+] Flatten `textStyle` option. `textStyle` exist in echarts option everywhere, for example, [series-bar.label.normal.textStyle](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#series-bar.label.normal.textStyle), [xAxis.axisLabel.textStyle](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#xAxis.axisLabel.textStyle). It seems that some of them are to deep and verbose. So we removed the level of `textStyle` to flatten them. That is, previous `label.normal.textStyle.fontSize`, `axisLabel.textStyle.fontSize` is modified to `label.normal.fontSize`, `axisLabel.fontSize` after `v3.7`. Of course, the previous style is compatible all the same. Those options are flattened:

    + `markPoint.data.label[normal|emphasis].textStyle`
    + `markLine.label[normal|emphasis].textStyle`
    + `markLine.data.label[normal|emphasis].textStyle`
    + `markArea.label[normal|emphasis].textStyle`
    + `markArea.data.label[normal|emphasis].textStyle`

    + `axisPointer.label.textStyle`
    + `timeline.label.textStyle`
    + `radar.name.textStyle`

+ [+] Supported [minInterval](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#xAxis.minInterval) on time axis (that is, [axis.type](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#xAxis.type) is `'time'`), and supported [maxInterval](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#xAxis.maxInterval) on value axis (that is [axis.type](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#xAxis.type) is `'value'`). So that it is enabled to controll the precision of label when data zooming.

+ [+] Supported [xAxis.axisLine.onZeroAxisIndex](https://ecomfe.github.io/echarts-doc/public/en/option.html#xAxis.axisLine.onZeroAxisIndex), which enables specifing corresponding relationship when multiple axes used and `onZero` is required.
